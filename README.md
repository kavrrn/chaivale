# Extraction of crop cycle parameters from multi-temporal data:
For a given set of multispectral multi-temporal data with timestamp of one year or more, develop and

implement an algorithm for extracting crop cycle parameters. Participants need to develop a high-
performance algorithm to analyse multi-temporal data at each pixel to extracting parameters such as

date of sowing, date of harvesting and number of harvests based on temporal profile.
